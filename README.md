# Algorithms Lab


## Usage

When in the directory for a particular problem, the following command will help you.
```
../algo
```

This script will build, run and test the solution you want with `../algo <solution>` and `../algo publish` will compile the writeup.

## Writeups

A nice script has been provided to compile and collect all writeups.
```
./publish_all.sh
```
