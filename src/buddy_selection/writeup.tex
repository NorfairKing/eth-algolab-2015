    This problem can be modeled as an undirected graph problem in which vertices are students and edges represent a possible bond.
    A possible bond is a the intersection of two sets of characteristics if the size of that intersection is greater than $f$.
    The size of the maximum cardinality matching of this graph is strictly smaller than  $\frac{n}{2}$ if and only if there exists an optimal solution.
    Luckily, Boost has a function that calculates the size of this matching.
