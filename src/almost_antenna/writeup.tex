  \begin{solution}{The naive approach}{n^{2}}{n}
    The naive approach is to remove every point from the set individually, recalculate the minimum boundin circle and keep the smallest radius.
  \end{solution}

  \begin{solution}{A clever approach}{n}{n}
    The key observation is that for most points, the removal will not reduce the size of the bounding circle.
    Only the removal of the bounding points makes a difference.
    Because there are at most three bounding points (according to the CGAL doccumentation), we only have to check three minimum bounding circles.
