  \begin{solution}{Textbook dynamic programming}{?}{?}
    This is a typical dynamic programming problem.

    The state is a matrix where the element of the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is maximum number of coins you can get in the situation where the coins indexed from $i$ to $j$ are left.
    The two possible previous states (from the previous turn) are $s[i][j-1]$ and $s[i+1][j]$.
    In our own turn we maximise and in our opponents turn we minimize.
