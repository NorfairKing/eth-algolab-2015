    This problem can be modeled as a graph problem where the vertices are islands and the edges bridges.
    If the problem concerned critical islands instead of critical bridges, the solution would be the articulation points.
    As it happens, the real solution is related.
    The key observation is that a bridge is critical if it is alone in its biconnected component.

    Luckily Boost has a function to find biconnected components.
