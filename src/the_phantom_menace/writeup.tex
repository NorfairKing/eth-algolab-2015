    This problem is modeled as a maxflow problem.

    For each astronomical object, we create two nodes in the graph model.
    One for the incoming links and on for the outgoing links.
    We then create an edge between them with capacity one that models that one ship can block paths through this node.
    Every link is modeled as an edge with capacity one.
    Every starting position gets an edge from the source and every destination gets an edge to the sink.
    The maxflow is then the result we're looking for.
