  \begin{solution}{The flow of bricks}{?}{?}
    The problem is modeled as a max-flow problem.

    Locations are represented by nodes.
    The source will be the node that represents the leftmost location: $0$ and the sink will be the node that represents the rightmost location: $w$.
    Every brick will represent an edge with capacity $1$ to represent the fact that it can be part of a wall.

    This model would solve the problem if not for the robustness constraint.

    To model the fact that any given location can only be used to house the end of a brick and the beginning of the next once, we will split every node into two and make an edge from the first to the second with capacity one.
