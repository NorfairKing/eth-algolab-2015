    The networks of the bugs are defined to be the output of Prims algorithm.
    In the case of distint edge weights, this is the same as the output of Kruskal's algorithm.
    We can therefore construct the bug's networks by applying Kruskal's algorithm to each of the bug's views of the path between the trees.
    When we combine all these minimum spanning trees in one graph, we can find the shortest path through the combined network with Dijkstra's algorithm.
