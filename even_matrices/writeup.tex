  \begin{solution}{A naive solution}{n^6}{1}
    The naive solution is to just go over all possible quadruples and count all the even sums of the bits inbetween them.

  \end{solution}
  
  \begin{solution}{A better solution}{n^4}{n^2}
    A better solution involves dynamic programming.
    It involves dynamically precomputing the sum of all bits in the square below $(i,j)$ for every tuple $(i,j)$.
    Checking whether the sums are even is then a constant-time operation.
    Take care, however, the twodimensional problem requires some extra thought.

  \begin{solution}{A clever solution}{n^3}{n}
    This solution re-uses the solution to the one-dimensional version of this problem.
    Essentially we are compressing every possible pair of rows down to a single row and applying the one-dimension version to that row.
